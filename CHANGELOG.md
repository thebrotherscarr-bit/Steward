## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **The engine card says how long it has been standing, and when it is idle.**
  The card already showed `started 10:58:58 AM` — a clock time you have to
  subtract from to learn anything. It now ticks a live elapsed beside it, and
  turns amber with `— idle Nm` once nothing has run for five minutes.

  The measurement behind it, taken across every sitting the core has ever
  recorded: a standup gets 69 seconds of engine time per run; sittings of two
  runs or fewer get 208, and there are 63 of them — **5.3 engine-hours for 91
  runs**. Twenty-two sittings were never closed at all. Sitting 74 held an
  engine thirty minutes for 2 runs, 82 held one fifty-four minutes for 5, and
  166 held one **sixteen minutes for zero**. The record had known for weeks;
  nothing on the glass said a word.

  **Idle is measured from the last turn, not from boot.** A first cut went
  amber only when nothing had EVER run, which misses the shape the waste
  actually takes — 74 and 82 both did work, then sat. A running turn is never
  idle however slow the model is: this must not scold a slow rack, only an
  engine nobody is using.

  Ticks at one second, not on the 15s poll, which would read as a broken clock.
  The interval clears itself the moment the span leaves the DOM — an
  idle-engine warning that leaked timers would be its own joke.

  `static/js/home.js` (`Home.age`), `static/css/app.css` (`.eng-idle`).
  Operator: "we can just add that to the dashboard to view as tasks are
  running in real time, right?"

- **The card counts the turns, from the door.** `/run/state` now carries `runs`
  and `last_run`; the engine counts every turn it pumps, in `Engine.tick`.
  Before this the glass used `Run.turn` — only what THIS TAB had seen, empty
  after a reload — so an engine that had run ten turns read as untouched.

  **A slash command is housekeeping, not work.** Booting sends `/warm` and
  `/status` through the same path, so a freshly opened engine reported "2 runs"
  before anyone asked it anything, and **"0 runs" — the state most worth
  shouting about — was unreachable.** Counted in `Run` after `pump` returns
  rather than inside `pump`, because pump cannot see the objective and only the
  caller knows what it was. An `Answer` always counts: that is his hand.

  **Idleness can never predate the engine.** With no runs, the client fell back
  to its own `turn.ended` — which survives a reboot — and a
  THIRTY-EIGHT-SECOND-OLD engine reported `idle 14m`, counting from a turn a
  previous engine had run. The floor is now this engine's own start.

  `internal/engine/engine.go`, `internal/tools/runstream.go`,
  `static/js/council.js`, `static/js/home.js`.

### Note
- Static assets are compiled into the binary (`//go:embed static/...`), so a
  change under `static/` needs `go build -o atlas-webapp.exe .` and a restart
  before it reaches the glass. Editing the file alone does nothing.
